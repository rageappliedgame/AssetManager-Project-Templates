Project templates for Visual Studio 2015/2017

The 3 C# templates files need to be copied (not unzipped) into the 'Visual Studio 2015\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#' or 'Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#' folder under 'My Documents'. Likewise the Typescript template needs to be placed in the 'Visual Studio 2015\Templates\ProjectTemplates\TypeScript' or 'Visual Studio 2015\Templates\ProjectTemplates\TypeScript' folder.

This repository also contains a zipped ready made 3 project C# RAGE Asset solution that can be simply unzipped.
After unzipping this solution, the assetmanager references have to be corrected and the 3 assets have to be renamed (subsitute your asset name for 'MyAsset' as assembly name in the project properties and finally the class names). 

Note: renaming the source file names will break the linking between the projects. If desireable, it can best be performed by carefully editing the 3 csproj files.
